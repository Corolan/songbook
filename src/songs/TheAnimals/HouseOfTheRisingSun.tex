There is a house in New Orleans, \tab    {\color{red}\textbf{a C D F} } \newline
They call the Rising Sun \tab    {\color{red}\textbf{a C E7 E7} } \newline
And It's been the ruin of many a poor boy \tab    {\color{red}\textbf{a C D F} } \newline
And God, I know, I'm one \tab    {\color{red}\textbf{a E a C D F a E a E} } \newline

My mother was a tailor			\newline
She sewed my new blue jeans			\newline
My father was a gambling man			\newline
Down in New Orleans			\newline

And the only things a gambler needs			\newline
Is a suitcase and a trunk			\newline
And the only time he's satisfied			\newline
Is when he's all a-drunk			\newline

I've got one foot on the platform			\newline
The other foot on the train			\newline
I'm going back to New Orleans			\newline
To wear the ball and chain			\newline

So mothers, tell your children			\newline
Not to do what I have done			\newline
Spend your life in sin and misery			\newline
In the house of the Rising Sun			\newline

There is a house in New Orleans,			\newline
They call the Rising Sun			\newline
And It's been the ruin of many a poor boy			\newline
And God, I know, I'm one			\newline
