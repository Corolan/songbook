See how I leave, with every piece of you					\tab    {\color{red}\textbf{a e} } \newline	
Don't underestimate the things that I will do				\tab    {\color{red}\textbf{F G} } \newline

Baby I have no story to be told, \newline

Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared \newline

\-\hspace{1cm} The scars of your love... \newline

\-\hspace{1cm} We could have had it all... \newline

Throw yourself through ever open door \newline
Count your blessings to find what you look for \newline
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold \newline
Pay me back in kind and you reap just what you sow \newline

\-\hspace{1cm} We could have had it all \newline
\-\hspace{1cm} We could have had it all  \newline
\-\hspace{1cm} It all \newline

\-\hspace{1cm} We could have had it all... \newline
