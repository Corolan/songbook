\-\hspace{1cm} Running around like a clown on purpose			 \newline
\-\hspace{1cm} Who gives a damn about the family you come from			 \newline
\-\hspace{1cm} No giving up when you’re young and you want some			 \newline

Running around again    	\tab    {\color{red}\textbf{C F a G} } \newline
Running from running   			 \newline

Waking up in the midday sun			 \tab    {\color{red}\textbf{C F a G} } \newline
What’s to live for?  you could see what I’ve done			 \newline
Staying out of motion in the light of day			 \newline
I was hiding from the things that you’d say			 \newline

We are golden, we are golden     			 \newline

Running around ...			 \newline

I was a boy at an open door			   \tab    {\color{red}\textbf{C F a G} } \newline
Why you staring do you still think that you know			 \newline
Looking for treasure in the things that you threw			 \newline
Like a magpie I live for glitter, not you			 \newline
We are not...   			 \newline

\-\hspace{1cm} Teenage dreams...			 \newline

Now I'm sitting alone and I'm looking for help		 \tab    {\color{red}\textbf{a C} } \newline

Many years have gone by I'm still wondering why			\tab    {\color{red}\textbf{F C} } \newline
Heaven let the world let it bleed me dry				\tab    {\color{red}\textbf{G C} } \newline
We are not what you think we are	|x3		 \newline
We are golden, we are golden			 \newline

\-\hspace{1cm} Teenage dreams...			 \newline

Running around ...			 \newline

We are not what you think we are		\tab    {\color{red}\textbf{C G F} } \newline
We are golden, we are golden
