The first two weeks turn into ten I hold my breath and wonder  		\newline
when it'll happen...does it really matter           		\newline
If half of what you said is true and half of what I didn't do  		\newline
Could be different...would it make it better? 		\newline
If we forget the things we know would we have somewhere to go  		\newline
The only way is down, i can see that now 		\newline
   
\-\hspace{1cm} Coz I don't care if I never talk to you again 		\newline
\-\hspace{1cm} this is not about emotion do i need a reason not to care 		\newline
\-\hspace{1cm} what you say or what happens in the end 		\newline
\-\hspace{1cm} this is my interpretation and it don't, don't make sense\tab 	{\color{red}\textbf{e A C D e - D C D} }\newline

Its really not such a sacrifice...	\tab 	{\color{red}\textbf{e D C} }\newline
